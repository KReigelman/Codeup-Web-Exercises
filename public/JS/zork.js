Should he leave?  More importantly, can Dave even make these choices or is he under the command of unseen forces.  Is some stranger at a keyboard somehwere controlling every move.  In any case, it would take far too long to walk south or east across the clearing.  There's a forest to his north and a pond to his west.";

var pondMessage = "Dave comes to a pond and nearly stumbles in. The water looks cool and refreshing and Dave is thirsty.  Dave sure would like a drink.  It\'s a big pond, extending far to the south and west.  To his north, Dave can see a house.  To his east, there\'s a large clearing.";

var houseMessage = "Dave finally reaches a house.  Is it his house?  His memory has been hazy since the accident.  The house is fenced in to the north and west.  He can see a forest to his east and a pond to his south.";

var winMessage = "Dave collapses on the couch inside the door.  He\'s still not sure this is his house but he feels a sense of accomplishment.  If life were a game, he\'d surely be winning.";
